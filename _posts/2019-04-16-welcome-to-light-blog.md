Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Check out the [Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home) for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Light Blog's repository](https://github.com/lynn9388/light-blog).
